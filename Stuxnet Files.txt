Files:

stuxnet-master\Dropper: mostly decompiled, some disassembled only, of seemingly all of the Stuxnet Dropper, but only some of the Main DLL (.stub)
	But definitely some of the DLL as ASM, but also not all of it
stuxnet-master\Rootkit: the rootkit driver (I believe only this and not the Load driver), decompiled

stuxnet_silverpoision\signed drivers\
	file1: another driver
	file2: another driver
	file3: MRxCls.sys, so, the Loader driver
		https://www.geoffchappell.com/notes/security/stuxnet/mrxcls.htm
		No Export Table
	file4: mrxnet.sys rootkit driver
		Export Table
stuxnet_silverpoision\stuxnet core\
	dropper.exe_: Stuxnet Dropper
		Contains seemingly-full .stub section contents, encrypted
	maindll.decrypted.unpacked.dll_: full contents of main dll unpacked from dropper's .stub section
		Contains all ordinal exports that have been identified as part of stuxnet's DLL, entry@15
stuxnet_silverpoision\~WTR4132.tmp: essentially the same as dropper.exe_, apart from a small few single-byte differences and a small chunk of different contents toward the end)
	Derived from resource 210
	Contains stub section
stuxnet_silverpoision\~WTR4141.tmp: loader for ~WTR4132.tmp
	Built from resource 241
	This file has the code to hook DLL APIs to monitor for certain filenames
stuxnet_silverpoision\A0055521.sys: no idea
stuxnet_silverpoision\Copy of...: initial execution stuff, or privesc or both
stuxnet_silverpoision\diffs...: diff of dropper.exe and ~WTR4132.tmp
stuxnet_silverpoision\dll.dll: no idea
stuxnet_silverpoision\malware.exe: it's dropper.exe, but missing ~4k of data from .stub
stuxnet_silverpoision\orig.rar: officially untampered, as opposed to the still-untampered unarchived files
stuxnet_silverpoision\suckme.lnk_: file rename (not mine) of the LNK file
